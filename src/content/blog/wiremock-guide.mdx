# Simulating API Responses with WireMock

External API dependencies can often slow down local development and make testing flaky. In this guide, we'll explore how to use **WireMock** to simulate API responses, eliminating the need for live external services during development.

## Why Mock?

1. **Speed**: No network latency.
2. **Reliability**: No downtime or rate limits.
3. **Cost**: Avoid usage fees for paid APIs.
4. **Edge Cases**: Easily simulate error states (500s, 404s) that are hard to reproduce with real APIs.

## Getting Started

First, let's install WireMock...
